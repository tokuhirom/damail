Damail
======

yet another IMAP4 web mail client for me.

This MUA is only useful for me.

SMTP support
------------

This application does not support SMTP yet.

I send mail in my day job on rare occasions.

But, I want a feature to send e-mail. Patches welcome.

Supported Browsers
------------------

I only tested Damail in stable version of Google Chrome on OSX.

But you can send me a patch for other browsers.

(I don't accept a patch for IE [6-8])
